# Getting started

* Create a /checkpoint directory in the /vatt directory and download the pretrained base-base-small model from <https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/vatt>
* Confirmed to be working with python 3.9.16
* updated the requirements.txt so that it works with latest version

## Dataset

* Look into ./vatt/data/datasets directory
    * We need to populate this place to get the model up and running
